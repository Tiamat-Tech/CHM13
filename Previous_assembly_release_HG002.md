# Previous assembly releases of T2T-HG002 Chromosomes X and Y

## HG002-XY

These assemblies were generated using sequencing data from HG002.

## XYv2.7
[Polished version of the T2T-HG002XY assembly](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/human-pangenomics/T2T/HG002/assemblies/chm13v1.1_hg002XYv2.7.fasta).
Unlike the T2T-CHM13v2.0, this version contains autosomes from T2T-CHM13v1.1 and X and Y from HG002.
The X and Y chromosome sequence is also available at [NCBI GCA_020881995.2](https://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/all/GCA/020/881/995/GCA_020881995.2_ASM2088199v2/).

## XYv2.0
[Pre-polished version of the T2T-HG002XY assembly](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/human-pangenomics/T2T/HG002/assemblies/chm13v1.1_hg002XYv2.0.fasta).

## Xv0.7
 [Draft assembly of the X chromosome](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/human-pangenomics/T2T/HG002/assemblies/HG002.chrX_v0.7.fasta.gz)
 with the same methods used for CHM13 asm v0.9 with HG002 data HiFi available from the [HPRC HG002](https://humanpangenome.org/hg002/) data freeze.
 Due to HiFI coverage gaps which were not patched, the draft is missing approximately 2 Mbp on the p-arm (including the PAR).
