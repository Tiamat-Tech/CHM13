# Telomere-to-telomere consortium CHM13 project

We have sequenced the CHM13hTERT human cell line with a number of technologies.
 Human genomic DNA was extracted from the cultured cell line.
 As the DNA is native, modified bases will be preserved.
 The data includes 30x [PacBio](https://www.pacb.com/) [HiFi](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra/?term=SRX789768*+CHM13),
 120x coverage of [Oxford Nanopore](https://nanoporetech.com), 70x [PacBio](https://www.pacb.com/) CLR, 50x [10X Genomics](https://www.10xgenomics.com),
 as well as [BioNano DLS](https://bionanogenomics.com/technology/dls-technology/) and [Arima Genomics HiC](https://arimagenomics.com/kit/).
 Most raw data is available from this site,
 with the exception of the PacBio data which was generated by the University of Washington/PacBio and is available from [NCBI SRA](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra?linkname=bioproject_sra_all&from_uid=269593).

A UCSC browser is available for [v2.0](https://genome.ucsc.edu/h/GCA_009914755.4)
 (as well as legacy [v1.0](http://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgTracks?genome=t2t-chm13-v1.0&hubUrl=http://t2t.gi.ucsc.edu/chm13/hub/hub.txt)
 and [v1.1](http://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgTracks?genome=t2t-chm13-v1.1&hubUrl=http://t2t.gi.ucsc.edu/chm13/hub/hub.txt) versions).
 An interactive dotplot visualization of all genomic repeats is also available from [resgen.io](https://resgen.io/paper-data/T2T-Nurk-et-al-2021/views/t2t-identity-v2).
 Known issues identified in the assembly are tracked at [CHM13 issues](https://github.com/marbl/CHM13-issues).

## Latest assembly release

### T2T-CHM13v2.0
[Complete T2T reconstruction of a human genome with Y](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/human-pangenomics/T2T/CHM13/assemblies/analysis_set/chm13v2.0.fa.gz).
Changes from v1.1 is the addition of a finished chromosome Y from the [GIAB](https://www.nist.gov/programs-projects/genome-bottle) HG002/NA24385 sample,
 sequenced both by [GIAB](https://github.com/genome-in-a-bottle/giab_data_indexes) and [HPRC](https://humanpangenome.org/hg002/).
 This genome is also available at [NCBI (GCA_009914755.4)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/assembly/GCA_009914755.4) and at [UCSC](https://genome.ucsc.edu/h/GCA_009914755.4).
 Note that even though the UCSC browser shows the Genbank accessions as sequence names on the browser itself, it can load annotations in BED/bigBed/BAM/CRAM/bigWig and other formats or search using the "chr1/2/etc" names.

Previous assembly releases are available below:
 - [T2T-CHM13](Previous_assembly_release_CHM13.md): v0.7-v1.1
 - [T2T-HG002XY](Previous_assembly_release_HG002.md): v0.7-2.7

## Notes on downloading files

Files are generously hosted by Amazon Web Services under s3://human-pangenomics/T2T/CHM13 and through this [web interface](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/human-pangenomics/index.html?prefix=T2T/CHM13).

Although available as straight-forward HTTP links, download performance is improved by using the Amazon Web Services [command-line interface](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/).
 References should be amended to use the `s3://` addressing scheme, i.e. replace `https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/human-pangenomics/T2T/` with `s3://human-pangenomics/T2T` to download.
 For example, to download `CHM13_prep5_S13_L002_I1_001.fastq.gz` to the current working directory use the following command.

    aws s3 --no-sign-request cp s3://human-pangenomics/T2T/CHM13/10x/CHM13_prep5_S13_L002_I1_001.fastq.gz .

or to download the full dataset use the following command.

    aws s3 --no-sign-request sync s3://human-pangenomics/T2T/CHM13/ .

The s3 command can also be used to get information on the dataset, for example reporting the size of every file in human-readable format.

    aws s3 --no-sign-request ls --recursive --human-readable --summarize s3://human-pangenomics/T2T/CHM13/ 

or to obtain technology-specific sizes.

    aws s3 --no-sign-request ls --recursive --human-readable --summarize s3://human-pangenomics/T2T/CHM13/nanopore/fast5
    aws s3 --no-sign-request ls --recursive --human-readable --summarize s3://human-pangenomics/T2T/CHM13/nanopore/rel2
    aws s3 --no-sign-request ls --recursive --human-readable --summarize s3://human-pangenomics/T2T/CHM13/assemblies

Amending the `max_concurrent_requests` etc. settings as per [this guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/topic/s3-config.html) will improve download performance further.
